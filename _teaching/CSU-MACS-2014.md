I assisted in the [Math in Action in Computer Science (MACS)](http://macs.cs.colostate.edu/) summer camp of 2014.
MACS is a week-long summer camp for middle school students from Cortez Middle School in Cortez Colorado, lead by [Shrideep Pallickara Ph.D](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~shrideep/).
In it, we teach a number of mathematical concepts in the context of programming ([see the list of modules](http://macs.cs.colostate.edu/programs.html)).

I was primarily a teaching assistant this year, interacting directly with multiple students with a wide variety of skill levels to help them understand the content and accomplish the goals set out in each module.

See a video (featuring me!) about this program (video is from the 2016 MACS program).
