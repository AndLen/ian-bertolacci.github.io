I assisted in the [Math in Action in Computer Science (MACS)](http://macs.cs.colostate.edu/) summer camp of 2014.
MACS is a week-long summer camp for middle school students from Cortez Middle School in Cortez Colorado, lead by [Shrideep Pallickara Ph.D](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~shrideep/).
In it, we teach a number of mathematical concepts in the context of programming ([see the list of modules](http://macs.cs.colostate.edu/programs.html)).

In 2016 I had two roles.
First, as a teaching assistant interacting directly with multiple students with a wide variety of skill levels to help them understand the content and accomplish the goals set out in each module.
Second, as a teacher developing the content for one of the modules (probabilities) and leading the discussion for that module.

See a video (featuring me!) about the program that year.
