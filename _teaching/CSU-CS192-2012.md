In this seminar, first year students are introduced to what computer science is, the ways of thinking like a computer scientist, and are given an opportunity to decide if computer science is the right major for them.
My role was to develop and modify small portions of the laboratory curriculum, occasionally lead and present material in lab sessions, and assist students both in the lab sessions and during office hours.
