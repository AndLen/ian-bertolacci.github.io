This class is the first requirement for the computer science degree at CSU. It introduces the Java programming language to students who have likely never programmed before, and introduces Boolean logic and simple proofs.
My role was to develop, modify, and overhaul large portions of the laboratory curriculum,lead and present material in lab sessions, and assist students both in the lab session and during office hours.
