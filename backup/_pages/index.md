Graduating MS student at University of Arizona.
Researching HPC by way of compilers and programming languages.
Will your application survive the next hardware?

My primary interests are developing compiler and programming languages.
How can we bring the power of the compiler to application developers, beyond being the thing that complains when they miss a semi-colon?
How can we build compiler frameworks that allow application developers to extend existing programming languages to create application specific abstractions that inform code transformations and optimizations?
