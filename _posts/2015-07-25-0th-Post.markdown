I guess the first post is a good place to describe who I am and what this blog will (attempt to) be about.

`> whoami`
---------
I am a super-senior undergraduate at [Colorado State University](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~ibertola/), where I study computer science and cognitive neuro-psychology, and [research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Bertolacci) compilers, languages, and high performance computing.


At the time of writing, I am currently an intern at [Cray](http://www.cray.com/) working with the [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com/) programming language group.  
I will go back to CSU in late August, and (begrudgingly) graduate in May 2016.

I plan to plan a plan for my post-graduate self.  
I am looking to go into research (either at a university or in industry) in $something involving scientific computing.  
$something changes about every 3-to-4 months.  
Right now $something == "HPC + protein folding as a tool to study drug effects and designing molecules for drug lesioning psychology studies.


I also drink near lethal amounts of black tea. Hence its inclusion into the blog title.

`> man blog`
-------------
This blog will serve a few functions

+ Air my thoughts:  
  Instead of having ideas or thoughts bounce around endlessly in my own skull, this can be a place where I hang them up to dry on the line. Hopefully someone will stumble here and start a dialogue.

+ Complaint/Rant zone:  
  I'd like to keep my therapist busy with legitimate issues; not the coding fluff that gives my stress-ball a sizeable chiropractor's bill.

+ Resource to other developers/students:  
  I wish I knew what I know now several years ago. And so here is where I will put things someone will come to regret not knowing about earlier.


`> man blog | grep "caveats"`
-----------------------------
I do not claim to be an expert in any field or to have extensive knowledge capable of trumping anyone else's opinions/expertise.  
I will, however, speak how I feel.  
Notice the keyword *Anger* in the blog title.

I may say something incorrect.  
In which case, you can feel free to correct me (in a respectable manner).  
I prefer listening to speaking.

Further, I do plan on covering some not-so-development/programming topics such as mental health, education, and other what-nots.  
The above also applies.
